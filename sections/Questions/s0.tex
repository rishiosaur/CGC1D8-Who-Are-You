\section{Who are the people in the photograph?}
I chose this question because of the mood of the photograph. The colors are dreary, evoking a sense of sadness. We also see that there is a person, presumably dead in the bottom-left corner, which sparks intrigue.

\section{What is the significance of the photo? Why does it exist?}
This photo looks dramatic, and so I have a feeling that there is some cultural or personal significance around it.

\section{If there is a problem, how might one resolve it?}
I'm not sure if there is a problem that is depicted in the image, but if there is, it would be interesting to see ways that people have tried, and will be trying to resolve it.
